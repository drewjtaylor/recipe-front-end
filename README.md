This is a project I created to exercise my ability to connect with an API, submit data using a form, and display returned information dynamically.

The [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) has a database of recipes and a robust set of data to work with. Recipes contain the obvious information such as a title, description, an image url, etc., but it also includes ways of narrowing down recipes by ingredient, specific diets (Atkins, paleo, etc.,) estimated prices, time to prepare, and more. Instructions are available as a simple HTTP paragraph, or as a broken down array of steps, each including a sentence of instruction, and further objects making up each ingredient.
